# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
This dataset contains data about a bank marketing campaign. We need to to predict whether a given client would subscribe to a term deposit or not. The dataset contained information about the last call that was made to the prospective client about the current campaign and the information about the client's credit history and demographic data

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
The best performing model w

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
Dataset was loaded with the provided URL, which was tabular dataset type. Cleaning the data was done proceeded by data spliting into train data and tets data.
Logistic regression was chosen as prediction model. Compute infra was created, hyperparameter tuning was donw using Random paramater sampling and Bandit early termination policy. 

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**
Random sampling supports discrete and continuous hyperparameters. It supports early termination of low-performance runs. In random sampling, hyperparameter values are randomly selected from the defined search space. The regularization hyperparameter (C) is set to ensure that our model does not overfit the data by penalizing addition of features. The max_iter (maximum iteration) hyperparameter controls the number of iterations to be done before we select our final model.

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**
Bandit policy is based on slack factor/slack amount and evaluation interval. Bandit terminates runs where the primary metric is not within the specified slack factor/slack amount compared to the best performing run.

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**
Training data was created using provided tabular dataset. AutoML pipeline is similar to Scikit-learn pipeline in terms of data pereparation and feature engineering. 

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**


## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
